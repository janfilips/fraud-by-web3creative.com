## Fraudulent Freelancer - Surjith S M

We got on a call with **Surjith S M**, and we agreed on the timeframe and scope of the work. He priced the total work at $4,500 and asked for $2,250 to be paid upfront. After that, there was a period of no communication from him. He eventually made **excuses** about time differences and being struck with a virus, although I could see on his GitHub that he was actively coding.

Three weeks down the line, with not a single line of code produced by him, we asked for a refund due to zero progress. He agreed to a full refund but then started coming up with bullshit bank **excuses** and eventually stopped communicating altogether. As you guessed correctly, he pocketed **-$2,250** from us and **delivered zero work** in return.

**Please exercise caution when considering him for any work!**
