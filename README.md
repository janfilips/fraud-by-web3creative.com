## The Fraud

The Fraud by **Surjith S M** from **Web3Templates** (https://web3templates.com/), also known as **Web3Creative** (https://web3creative.com) and **Surjith S M** (https://surjithctly.in/). 

I guess lesson learned: trust anything that’s got Web3 in it…


## Fraudulent Freelancer - Surjith S M

We got on a call with Surjith S M, and we agreed on the timeframe and scope of the work. He priced the total work at $4,500 and asked for $2,250 to be paid upfront. After that, there was a period of no communication from him. He eventually made **excuses** about time differences and being struck with a virus, although I could see on his GitHub that he was actively coding.

Three weeks down the line, with not a single line of code produced by him, we asked for a refund due to zero progress. He agreed to a full refund but then started coming up with bullshit bank **excuses** and eventually stopped communicating altogether. As you guessed correctly, he **pocketed $2,250** from us and **delivered zero work in return**.

**Scam from the get go!**
